# 🌐 Connecting Ideas, Expanding Systems

Hi there! I'm Susie — I turn scattered ideas into systems that scale.

I don’t just build things — I **expand them**.  
From AI to blockchain, from backend systems to mobile UX, I explore how different layers come together to create meaningful products.  
Whether it’s crafting an experience or designing a system, I enjoy the full cycle: **think → build → iterate → scale**.
