### 🌟 My Evolution & Key Projects
From full-stack Web3 experiments to refined serverless SaaS launches, each project evolves toward faster, cheaper, more secure, and truly validated problem-solving:

- **Fundit (2025)**  
  Built a Web3 insurance crowdfunding DApp where users propose policies and providers bid in auctions, automating transparent contracts and rewards (full-stack, Node + EC2 + Solidity).  
  **Awarded Grand Prize (1st Place) at the Base Hackathon**

- **ProofIN (2025)**  
  Created a tamper-proof rental damage assessment DApp using NFTs for immutable records, AI-assisted detection, and strict on/off-chain separation for maximum cost efficiency (Node + Lambda serverless).  
  **Awarded 3rd Prize (Excellence Award) at the RISE Startup Competition**  
  *(Note: MVP launched as FairStay — a Web2 version to lower entry barriers and validate AI detection first; future plan includes seamless Web2 → Web3 migration for full NFT integration.)*

- **SyncMe (2025)**  
  Developed a simple web mood-tracker with instant character rewards and social sharing, focusing on serverless backend speed and cost control (Java + Lambda + CI/CD).

- **Chronos (Ongoing)**  
  Launched a secure, local browser-based file converter that eliminates uploads, ads, and decisions, validated end-to-end with full server + client dashboards (Node + Lambda + OIDC).

Supporting projects:
- **Blockwave Quant Developer (2025)** — Real-time unlock calendar short strategy bot for automated trading signals.
- **Ebook-to-Audio Generative AI (2025)** - Text-to-audio mapping data pipeline that extracts emotional and tonal cues from novels.
- **Netflix Clone (2025)** — End-to-end streaming platform replica with full backend, frontend, and AWS deployment.
- **NLP RAG Chatbot (2024)** — Intelligent Q&A system with embedding, wiki parsing, and retrieval pipeline.
- **오이마켓 (2024)** — Basic CRUD marketplace deployed on Elastic Beanstalk, RDS, and S3.
- **Data Analysis (2022–2023)**  
  Policy impact studies using VECM/SCM and QGIS optimal location scoring.  
  **Hydrogen Charging Station Optimization: Encouragement Award at National Data Mentoring Contest** (featured on National Data Map homepage)  
  **Real Estate Regulation Impact Study: Honorable Mention at DB Financial Economics Contest**

- **Teaching (2021–2023)** — Korean language instruction and hands-on R data analysis workshops.
